<h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
<p>&quot;In the beginning of creation, when Marc made the database UI, the website 
was without form and void, with darkness over the face of the HTML, and a mighty 
script that swept over the surface of the IDE.&nbsp; Marc said, 'Let there be a 
database spider UI', and there was a database spider UI; and Marc saw that the 
UI was good, and he separated primary keys from foreign keys.&nbsp; He called 
the foreign keys parent/child relationships, and the darkness Ruby on Rails.&nbsp; 
So evening came, and morning came, the first day.&quot;</p>
